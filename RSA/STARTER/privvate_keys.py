#Solution
#The code calculates the modular inverse of e (which is 65537) modulo the totient of N, where N is the product of two large primes p and q. 
# The inverse function from Crypto.Util.number is used to compute the modular inverse. 
# This is typically done in RSA encryption to find the private key d such that d * e â‰¡ 1 (mod tot). 
# The printed result will be the value of d, which is the modular inverse of e with respect to tot.
