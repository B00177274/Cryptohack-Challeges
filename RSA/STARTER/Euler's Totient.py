print((p-1)*(q-1))


#Solution 

#The code calculates the Euler's totient function for two prime numbers, p and q, which is used in RSA cryptography.
#  It subtracts 1 from each prime and multiplies the results to find the totient value. 
# This calculation is crucial for determining the private key in RSA encryption. 
# The value of the totient is printed after performing the arithmetic on the given primes p and q.
