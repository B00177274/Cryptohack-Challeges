print(pow(101, 17, 22663))



#Solution
#The result of pow(101, 17, 22663) is 19906.
#  This expression calculates 101 raised to the power of 17, modulo 22663. 
# It efficiently computes the result without directly performing large number multiplications. 
# The pow function with three arguments is used here for modular exponentiation
