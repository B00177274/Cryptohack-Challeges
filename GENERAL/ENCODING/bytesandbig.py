#Solution

#The code takes a large integer value (integers) and converts it into its hexadecimal representation using the hex() function, excluding the "0x" prefix with slicing [2:].

#The resulting hexadecimal string (hex_num) is then decoded into bytes using the bytes.fromhex() method, effectively translating the hexadecimal data into a binary format.

#The decoded byte sequence is stored in the variable flag, which is then printed as a human-readable string to reveal the encoded message.

#This script demonstrates how to handle large integers, convert them into hexadecimal format, and further decode them to extract meaningful information, often useful in cryptographic challenges.

#The import numpy line is unnecessary as numpy is not used anywhere in the script, making it redundant.
